# CORE-IQ Demo

This is a lightweight demo that displays audience insights by UK postcode or US ZIP code. Enter a code to see the relevant Experian Mosaic groups and media consumption indices.

The page also lets you describe your target audience and optionally provide a media budget. These inputs are used to surface the best matching Experian Mosaic subgroup and a weighted budget split across recommended media channels.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter a postcode or ZIP code.
3. Optionally describe your target audience and set a budget.
4. Review the suggested Mosaic subgroup, media indices and budget allocation.

The application is static and loads JSON data client-side, so it can be embedded in other pages (for example, within a HubSpot iframe).
